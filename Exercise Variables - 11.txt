# Modify the variables as suggested

a = 'hello' #capitalize
b = 'tom' #uppercase
c = 'LAURA' #lowercase
question = 'How are you' #change o in e
age_question = 'How old are you?' #use the correct method to create a string for each word
print(a, b, c, question, age_question)


SOLUTION:-
a.capitalize()
b.upper()
c.lower()
question.replace("o", "e")
age_question.split()
